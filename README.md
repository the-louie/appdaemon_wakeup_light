# Wakeup Light for Home Assistant

A highly efficient and intelligent wakeup light automation for Home Assistant using AppDaemon. This script gradually increases light brightness during wakeup times, providing a natural and gentle way to wake up.

## üåü Features

### **Smart Scheduling**
- **Intelligent Time Management**: Only runs during active wakeup windows, not 24/7
- **Dynamic Scheduling**: Automatically schedules the next action based on current time
- **Calendar Integration**: Respects calendar exceptions to skip wakeup lights on special days
- **Daily Optimization**: Checks calendar once at 03:30 AM and caches the result

### **Efficient Performance**
- **97% CPU Reduction**: Runs ~30-50 times per day instead of 1440 times (every minute)
- **Minimal Resource Usage**: Only active during wakeup windows
- **Smart Caching**: Calendar exceptions checked once per day, not every minute
- **Optimized Scheduling**: Single timer management with proper cleanup

### **Flexible Configuration**
- **Per-Day Settings**: Different wakeup times for each day of the week
- **Customizable Brightness**: Adjustable maximum brightness (0-255)
- **Smooth Transitions**: Configurable brightness adjustment frequency
- **Weekend Support**: Easy to disable on weekends or holidays

### **Reliable Operation**
- **Enterprise-Grade Code**: Clean, maintainable, and well-documented
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing configuration
- **State Management**: Proper timer cleanup and state consistency
- **Defensive Programming**: Robust null checks and validation

## üöÄ Benefits

### **For Users**
- **Natural Wakeup**: Gradual light increase mimics natural sunrise
- **Better Sleep Quality**: Gentle wakeup process improves sleep patterns
- **Customizable**: Tailored to individual schedules and preferences
- **Reliable**: Works consistently without manual intervention

### **For System Performance**
- **Low Resource Usage**: Minimal impact on Home Assistant performance
- **Efficient Scheduling**: Smart timing reduces unnecessary executions
- **Clean Codebase**: Easy to maintain and extend
- **Scalable**: Can handle multiple lights and complex schedules

## üìã Requirements

- **Home Assistant** with AppDaemon installed
- **Light entity** that supports brightness control
- **Calendar entity** (optional, for exceptions)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. **Copy the script** to your AppDaemon `apps` directory:
   ```
   apps/i1_wakeup_light.py
   ```

2. **Add configuration** to your AppDaemon `conf` directory:
   ```yaml
   # apps.yaml
   wakeupLight:
     module: i1_wakeup_light
     class: WakeupLight
     entity: "light.your_light_entity"
     calendar: "calendar.your_calendar"  # optional
     max_brightness: 255
     freq: 60
     days:
       monday:
         active: true
         start: "6:20"
         end: "6:40"
         turnoff: "6:50"
       # ... configure other days
   ```

3. **Restart AppDaemon** to load the new app

## üîß Configuration Options

### **Required Parameters**
- `entity`: Light entity ID to control
- `days`: Daily schedule configuration

### **Optional Parameters**
- `calendar`: Calendar entity for exceptions (default: none)
- `max_brightness`: Maximum brightness 0-255 (default: 254)
- `freq`: Brightness adjustment frequency in seconds (default: 60)

### **Day Configuration**
Each day supports:
- `active`: Enable/disable for this day (true/false)
- `start`: Start time for brightness ramp (HH:MM)
- `end`: End time for brightness ramp (HH:MM)
- `turnoff`: Time to turn off light completely (HH:MM)

## üìÖ Example Configuration

```yaml
wakeupLight:
  module: i1_wakeup_light
  class: WakeupLight

  # Light entity to control
  entity: "light.bedroom_lamp"

  # Calendar for exceptions (school holidays, etc.)
  calendar: "calendar.school_holidays"

  # Maximum brightness (0-255)
  max_brightness: 255

  # Brightness adjustment frequency (seconds)
  freq: 60

  # Daily schedule
  days:
    monday:
      active: true
      start: "6:20"      # Start brightness ramp
      end: "6:40"        # Full brightness reached
      turnoff: "6:50"    # Turn off completely
    tuesday:
      active: true
      start: "6:20"
      end: "6:40"
      turnoff: "6:50"
    wednesday:
      active: true
      start: "6:30"
      end: "6:50"
      turnoff: "7:00"
    thursday:
      active: true
      start: "6:30"
      end: "6:50"
      turnoff: "7:00"
    friday:
      active: true
      start: "6:30"
      end: "6:50"
      turnoff: "7:00"
    saturday:
      active: false      # No wakeup light on weekends
    sunday:
      active: false      # No wakeup light on weekends
```

## üéØ How It Works

### **Daily Operation**
1. **03:30 AM**: Checks calendar for exceptions and caches the result
2. **Setup Phase**: Determines today's schedule and current time
3. **Smart Scheduling**:
   - Before start time: Schedules brightness cycle
   - During ramp time: Runs brightness adjustments
   - After end time: Schedules turnoff
   - Past turnoff: No action needed

### **Brightness Control**
- **Gradual Increase**: Brightness ramps from 0 to max over the specified time window
- **Smooth Transitions**: Adjustments occur at the configured frequency
- **Automatic Turnoff**: Light turns off at the specified turnoff time

### **Exception Handling**
- **Calendar Exceptions**: Respects calendar events to skip wakeup lights
- **Inactive Days**: Automatically skips days marked as inactive
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of missing configuration or entities

## üîç Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

**Light doesn't turn on:**
- Check entity ID is correct
- Verify light supports brightness control
- Check AppDaemon logs for errors

**Wrong timing:**
- Verify time format is HH:MM
- Check day names are lowercase (monday, tuesday, etc.)
- Ensure active is set to true for desired days

**Calendar exceptions not working:**
- Verify calendar entity ID
- Check calendar state (should be "on" for exceptions)
- Review AppDaemon logs at 03:30 AM

### **Logging**
The script provides detailed logging:
- Initialization messages
- Schedule setup information
- Brightness adjustment details
- Calendar exception status

## üöÄ Performance Metrics

### **Before Optimization**
- **Executions per day**: ~1,440 (every minute)
- **Calendar checks**: 1,440 per day
- **CPU usage**: High (continuous operation)

### **After Optimization**
- **Executions per day**: ~30-50 (only during active windows)
- **Calendar checks**: 1 per day
- **CPU usage**: Minimal (97% reduction)
- **Memory usage**: Optimized with single timer management

## ü§ù Contributing

This script is designed to be:
